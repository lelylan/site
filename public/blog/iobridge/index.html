  <ul class="media-grid">
    <li>
    <a href="https://www.iobridge.com/"><img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/iobridge/header.png" alt="ioBridge"></a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  <a href="http://www.iobridge.com">ioBridge</a> is a solution that enables everyone to connect
  easily any object to the internet envisioning a world where physical objects are interacting
  with the most important element on Earth: <strong>you</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
  ioBridge allows your devices to communicate with social networks, to control and monitor any physical
  device and to take your project from prototype to the real product manufacturing and licensing
  patent-pending technologies to create Internet-enabled devices. Its target goes from
  <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/manufacturers/">manufacturer</a> till the
  <a href="https://store.iobridge.com/">casual user</a> and they offer a secure, private,
  scalable platforms from DIY home projects to commercial products and professional
  applications. 
  </p>

  <p>
  What is really interesting is the <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/labs/">lab section</a>. We knew that 
  ioBridge was the mind back to <a href="http://thingspeak.com">ThingSpeak</a>, an IoT open source platform 
  for storing and retrieving data using HTTP commands already featured in <a href="/blog/thingspeak/">
  a previous article</a> but they do not stop here. They take the 20% of their time to create other
  interesting projects like CheerLights (used to enable people all around the world to link lights and 
  applications together) or ioAuth (a work in progress set of open standards that involve how devices 
  authenticate with an API).
  </p>

  <h2>Market ready</h2>

  <p>
  One aspect that in our opinion makes ioBridge one step further the other startups is that
  probably it's wrong to call ioBridge a startup. They exist from 2009, they have been selected
  from ReadWriteWeb as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2009/12/08/08readwriteweb-top-10-internet-of-things-products-of-2009-74048.html">top ten Internet of Things (2009)</a>
  and from New York Times as one of the <a href="http://www.iobridge.net/projects/2010/01/iobridge-5-technology-trends-to-watch-in-2010/">five technologies to watch in 2010</a>
  and they make real businesses with partnerships they have built in those 4 years with names like
  <a href="http://www.powercastsensors.com/remote-monitoring-integration-with-iobridge-pro-20120116/">Powercast</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ereleases.com/pr/solis-usa-offers-professional-energy-services-retail-applications-based-remote-monitoring-control-technology-iobridge-54087">Solis</a>
  and <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/geosyntec-consultants-signs-strategic-teaming-agreement-for-high-performance-green-infrastructure-computing-platform-123545629.html">Geosyntec</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Give me some hardware</h2>

  <p>
  ioBridge has an <a href="https://store.iobridge.com/">online shop</a> where you can buy hardware.
  ioBridge's technology is designed to make it cost effective and easy for everyone to internet-enable almost
  anything. You can find <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/products/sensors_and_actuators.html">sensors and 
    actuators</a> that enable customers to monitor things like temperature and humidity or to control things
  like lights and <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/products/web_gateways.html">web gateways</a> to easily
  connect ioBridge provided or third-party sensors, switches, and other devices to the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
  But they do not stop here. For serious stuff ioBridge licenses <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/manufacturers/">
    iota</a>, a really cool piece of hardware to build low cost and scalable applications. The best
  part about iota is that you get immediate connectivity using wifi or ethernet using high encryption
  and secure tunneling to and from web services. With this kind of solutions everything from the
  hardware, licensing, and cloud services are ready to use and to scale. 
  </p>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Connecting to the web with realtime.io</h2>

  <p>
  ioBridge solution consists of low-cost embedded hardware and firmware that is tightly integrated with
  scalable cloud services and dashboards. To reach this result they created <a href="http://realtime.io">realtime.io</a>,
  a gateway between devices and applications that offers real-time data plus ability to remote control and
  monitor your devices. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Their embedded devices are designed to be <a href="http://www.iobridge.com/technology/">easy to install and connect</a>
  to realtime.io. They bypass firewalls and communicate directly to the ioBridge servers on the web. No port-forwarding
  or dynamic DNS configuration is required making installation easy for the everyday user. They are able to support
  100.000 to 1.000.000 devices per server in low-traffic situations.
  </p>

  <p>
  ioBridge provides a free web interface and configurable dashboard. Developers can create new dashboards to
  monitor and control almost anything without writing any software, but just in case, they provide an API
  that can be used by developers or customers to create their own custom applications or to integrate with
  their own or other third-party systems.
  </p>

  <h2>ioBridge Connect</h2>

  <p>
  To setup, monitor, and control your devices you must use the <a href="https://www.iobridge.com/interface">ioBridge Interface</a>.
  Once you have purchased one of the ioBridge gateways you can use ioBridge to control it. Create your
  account, add the link for your gateway and unlock all its features. The default account
  is <a href="http://iobridge.com/signup/index.html">free</a>.
  </p>

  <ul class="media-grid">
    <li>
    <a href="https://www.iobridge.com/"><img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/iobridge/dashboard.png" alt="ioBridge dashboard"></a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Once you have signed in you can find these sections:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
    <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/interface/">Dashboard</a>.
    Customizable home screen for quick access to modules and widgets
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/web-gateway-modules/module-configuration/">Modules</a>.
    Table of your linked gateways for access to configuration, monitoring and control.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/widgets/">Widgets</a>.
    Links to your widgets.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/actions/">Actions</a>.
    Access to actions, events and links to create new actions.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Functionalities explained</h2>

  <h3><a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/widgets/">Widgets</a></h3>

  <p>
  Widgets are simple script objects that either control outputs or monitor inputs. ioBridge offers
  different kind of widgets to <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/widgets/io/">monitor i/o</a>,
  <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/widgets/servo/">control servo positions</a>
  and <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/widgets/chart/">visualize charts</a>.
  You can also place the widget in-line into your blog or website by using the automatically
  generated embedded code and customizing the look and feel with few lines of CSS.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/actions/">Actions</a></h3>

  <p>
  Actions are a mix between web-hooks to post realtime data to external services and integrated
  applications that can easily enhance your functionalities. In this ioBridge takes the best feature of
  ThingSpeak giving you extra applications like text messaging, twitter integration, mail notifications and more.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/onboard-actions/">Rules</a></h3>

  <p>
  A rule is essentially an if/then statement like "If the temperature is too high, then 
  turn on the fan". You can break that rule down into two distinct parts: a condition
  and an action. With ioBridge you can create multiple conditions and multiple actions under
  each rule and If there are multiple conditions for a rule, all the conditions must be true
  for the action(s) to be executed. In rules with multiple actions, all of the actions will
  be executed when the rule is true. This service lives directly on the physical board but the
  definition part is online through web based wizards.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/api/">API</a></h3>

  <p>
  The APIs are not as rich as we could expect from a complete service like ioBridge.
  They mainly offer a way to access to <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/api/data-feed-api/">data feeds</a>
  for every device registered on your account and a bit more. The feed service returns a JSON or XML
  snapshot of your device input and output states as well as extra meta information you can set such as
  location, latitude, longitude and more.

    }

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>
  ioBridge is a full featured platform and the only one at the same level of <a href="http://cosm.com">cosm</a>.
  They have easy to connect hardware and a basic API to improve the platform. It's easy 
  <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-internet-of-things">to start with</a>
  and we were quite impressed by the <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/docs/">complete documentation</a>,
  the <a href="http://connect.iobridge.com/tutorials/">tutorials</a> and the commercial applications
  where ioBridge is used. From a business point of view lot of IoT startup should learn from them.
  </p>

  <p>
  Anyway, there is a tradeoff. Their business model is based on collaboration where partners
  uses their products, both hardware and software. One limitation comes up quite clear. As far
  as they make money allowing only their own products <strong>they will not create an open platform</strong>. 
  The poor APIs clearly show this direction. This limit is a strong one.
  </p>

  <p>
  We do not like the ioBridge business model, but those are just personal points of view. The important
  point is that right now they are doing well. We also shouldn't forget that they are contributing
  to the community with cool stuff like <a href="www.thingspeak.com">ThingSpeak</a>. We only wished they
  could be a bit more open. Will this happen? And will it be sustainable?
