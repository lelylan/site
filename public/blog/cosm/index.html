  <ul class="media-grid">

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  COSM is a platform which enables you to store, share and discover real-time sensor, 
  energy and environment data from devices and sensors. Cosm provides most of its 
  functionality through its API, rather than through its web site, giving to developers
  a full set of services that we will be describing in this article.
  </p>

  <h2>Once upon a time there was Pachube</h2>

  <p>
  When it started, around 4 years ago, its name was Pachube. It was ideally suited 
  for visualizing data from sensors connected to the physical world. The main concepts 
  on which Pachube came to life was two: feeds and datastreams.
  </p>

  <ul class="unstyled">
    <li><code>Feeds</code> Usually a location (e.g. office and house).</li>
    <li><code>Datastreams</code> The physical device associated to the location
    (e.g. sensors and power meters).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  A few months ago, it had a facelift and it changed its name to Cosm. Cosm is everything 
  you know and love about Pachube, with more power to connect and build the Internet of 
  Things today. The data about Cosm is quite impressive. It manages millions of datapoints 
  per day from thousands of individuals, organisations and companies around the world. Data 
  can be pushed from the sensor end, or pulled by the Cosm servers, with the data feeds 
  then made available in multiple formats at no charge.
  </p>

  <p>
  In its new vest Cosm tries to be a social network for the Internet of Things, but as
  reported by <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/cosm-disappointing-re-design-by-internet-of-things-pioneer-pachube.php">Read Write Web</a>,
  at least two problems raised. The first one is that Cosm tries to be now mainstream, it
  tries to be "for everybody", but it is not ready for this step. Its UI is not enough
  intuitive. Second, when you go into the console you can't do that much, at least if 
  you do not have an Arduino. After a while you just leave it. This is an extract I really 
  like of the RWW article.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
    I'm being a little hard on Cosm, because I was expecting something more user friendly. However, 
    I still buy into the vision for Cosm. In a close future, we will indeed manage various 
    feeds from household and other devices...
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  After studying their APIs we think Cosm is a great product. It has almost all
  the services needed to build the Internet of Things and when hardware producers will
  realize that, it will start making big numbers. Enough with the introduction, it's API time.
  </p>

  <h2>Cosm APIs</h2>

  <p>
  The <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/quickstart">API documentation</a> is complete. There is 
  quickstart which lets you create your first feed following a step by step wizard. Although it
  is clear and well prepared, we didn't like the idea of importing the Twitter feed in Cosm as
  first example as it's not a use case for the Internet of Things. This said lets dig into the 
  services.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/feed/">FEEDS</a></h3>

  <p>
  It represents a group of datastreams. It is used to represent some locations like your 
  house or your office. It's interesting the ability to tag the feeds to make them easily 
  searchable and also the ability to set latitude and longitude to enable geospatial queries.
  <p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/datastream/">DATASTREAMS</a></h3>

  <p>
  A datastream represents an individual sensor/device stream within an environment like
  powermeters, lights or geiger counters. In here the values related to the physical 
  device properties are stored.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/datapoint/">DATAPOINTS</a></h3>

  <p>
  A datapoint represents the value in a specific moment of the datastream life. This 
  enables you to insert datapoints into the history of the datastream.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/api_key/">API KEYS</a></h3>

  <p>
  Cosm lets you create API keys with granular permissions. Keys are composed of different 
  sets of permissions, so for example we could create a key that allows read-only access to
  all public resources or allows write-access to one specific feed, from one specific IP 
  address. Those are the most important properties in the key resource.
  </p>

  <ul class="unstyled">
    <li><code>expires_at</code> Gives a temporary limit.</li>
    <li><code>private_access</code> Flag if this key can access private resources.</li>
    <li><code>permissions</code> List of access level.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The permission structure is another resource and those are the most interesting 
  properties you should be aware of.
  </p>

  <ul class="unstyled">
    <li><code>access_method</code> An array containing one or more of [get, put, post, delete].</li>
    <li><code>source_ip</code> An IP address that access should be restricted to,
    <li><code>minimum_interval</code> Can be used to create a key that can only request data 
    with a certain resolution.</li>
    <li><code>resources</code> An optional collection of resources restricting access 
    to specific feeds or datastreams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/trigger/">TRIGGERS</a></h3>

  <p>
  Triggers fire HTTP POST requests to a URL of your choice when conditions that you 
  set up on a datastream have been satisfied (e.g. value change, value exceeds threshold, 
  value equals, etc.).
  </p>

  <p>
  This service can be useful in different scenarios. For example to turn off the cooling 
  system when a window is open or when the water for your flowers is finished. In this way,
  using a webhook mechanism you can connect Cosm feeds and datastreams with any other app.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/user/">USERS</a></h3>

  <p>
  User are ideally a powerful concept, as there are some situations where you have
  to create new people, so that you can let them access your resources for a limited 
  period of time. Unluckily the resource is not open and you have to make a request to 
  Cosm if you want to use it.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/v2/history.html">HISTORICAL QUERY</a></h3>

  <p>
  Gives the ability to make queries for ranges of historical data at datastream level
  as well as at the environment level, using formatted dates. The API lets you set the
  param <code>interval</code>, which can be pretty useful to reduce the amount of retrieved
  data letting you get back the historical resources with intervals of 30 seconds, one minute,
  5 minutes and so on.
  </p>


  <h2>Beta features</h2>

  <p>
  Cosm is delivering also different <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/">beta</a> features, 
  which are just delicious.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/group/">GROUPS</a></h3>

  <p>
  Groups can be used for two main reasons: organize both users and feeds, and create 
  more advanced access rules for private feeds. If used in the right way, they can make your 
  system much more flexible and open to other users.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/permission/">PERMISSIONS</a></h3>

  <p>
  The permissions API allows you to get information about what an API Key is allowed to 
  do.
  <p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/socket_server/">SOCKET SERVER</a></h3>

  <p>
  Paws is the Cosm Advanced Web-scale Socket-server. It is designed to make writing 
  clients which require real-time push notifications as easy as possible.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/mqtt/">MQTT</a></h3>

  <p>
  The Cosm MQTT Bridge is a simple way to interact with Cosm directly from any MQTT
  enabled platform. It provides full API interaction, as well as push notifications
  and subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/oauth/">OAUTH2</a></h3>

  <p>
  OAuth2 is a method for allowing third-party application access to your resources 
  without giving them access to your username and password. It is used by most major 
  websites including Facebook and Twitter and its biggest strength lies in its ability 
  to let the user have full control of its resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Provisioning beta. A delicious service</h2>

  <p>
  The <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/device_management/provisioning/">provisioning</a> 
  service is just awesome. Provisioning is the process of a device getting its configuration 
  in order to be able to send data to Cosm. This service simplify our lives when thinking 
  at the physical world allowing the owner of the device to 'claim' it. For example once 
  your device is plugged in and online, you might go to its website, enter your serial 
  number and claim it there, and this would all be done using the provisioning APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
  When the physical device is plugged in this is what happens.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>It sends an activation code to the provisioning API.</li>
    <li>The API creates a feed (which can be preconfigured).</li>
    <li>The API creates an API key that is sent to the device. This key will be used by 
    the physical device to authenticate itself when sending updates.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  Without getting into the details Cosm let you define two resources. The first one is the 
  <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/device_management/api/device_model/">Device Model</a> 
  and it represents a class of devices, like the "Boxee" and the second is 
  <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/device_management/api/device/">Device</a>, 
  which represents an individual device with its own serial number.
  </p>

  <p>
  Without going further, go and read the <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/beta/device_management/provisioning/">documentation</a>.
  It will be worth it.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>
  Cosm is for sure the most complete service out there. It offers all the services we need to 
  build the Internet of Things, and it does it well. At first all of those concepts are not easy
  to grasp, but give it the right time and you will get excited about what you can do. It's a 
  metter of time and its success will start to be visible to everyone.

  first article of a series that wants to get in deep about the Internet of Things ecosystem.
